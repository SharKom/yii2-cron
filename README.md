Yii2 Cron job Manager
=====================
Create Cron jobs from browser, and look that run logs

Forked from vasadibt/yii2-cron with some modifications:

1. Now it can run every kind of script, not only Yii2 console commands
2. Added capability to have a log file in addition to DB logs
3. Removed the runquick capabilities

'controllerMap' => [
    'migrate' => [
        'class' => 'yii\console\controllers\MigrateController',
        'migrationPath' => [
            '@sharkom/cron/migrations',
        ],
    ],
],
```

Then run:
```
yii migrate/up
```
